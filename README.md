This is a spot for all of the minecraft mods I plan to make. I need to study Java and thought this would be the best way to do so. Finished JAR files will be put in the jar file folder when I finish. 

## Roadmap

- :heavy_check_mark: Stone Armor Mod (My first one!)
- :thought_balloon: Many Armors Mod (An extension of my first one)
  - armors to be included: cobblestone, cobbledeepslate, netherrack, lapis, emerald, amethyst, quartz, coal, copper, netherbrick, redstone, torch helmet
- :thought_balloon: Many Weapons Mod (And extension on the second one)
- :thought_balloon: More Animals Mod (Capybara)
- :thought_balloon: Pink Ore mod (New ore with natural generation like lapis, armor, tools, block can be crafted (strongest in water on sunny days, stinky lines when having the full set(perferably pink)))
