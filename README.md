This is a spot for all of the minecraft mods I plan to make. I need to study Java and thought this would be the best way to do so. Finished JAR files will be put in the jar file folder when I finish. 

## Roadmap

:heavy_check_mark: Stone Armor Mod (My first one!)
:thought_balloon: Many Armors Mod
:thought_balloon: Many Weapons Mod
:thought_balloon: More Animals Mod (Capybara)
