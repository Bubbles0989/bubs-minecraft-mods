This is a spot for all of the minecraft mods I plan to make. I need to study Java and thought this would be the best way to do so. Finished JAR files will be put in the jar file folder when I finish. 

## Roadmap

- :heavy_check_mark: Stone Armor Mod (My first one!)
- :thought_balloon: Many Armors Mod (An extension of my first one)
  - armors to be included: cobblestone :heavy_check_mark:, cobbledeepslate :heavy_check_mark:, netherrack :heavy_check_mark:, glass :heavy_check_mark:, lapis :thought_balloon:, emerald :heavy_check_mark:, amethyst :heavy_check_mark:, quartz :thought_balloon:, coal :thought_balloon:, copper :thought_balloon:, netherbrick :heavy_check_mark:, redstone :thought_balloon:, torch helmet :heavy_check_mark:
- :thought_balloon: Many Weapons Mod (An extension on the second one)
  - add the swords for cobblestone, cobbledeepslate, netherrack, glass, lapis, emerald, amethyst, quartz, coal, copper, netherbrick, redstone, torch helmet
  - add bows of alternate types: iron, gold, diamond, lapis, emerald, amethyst, quartz, coal, copper, redstone 
- :thought_balloon: Pink Ore mod (New ore with natural generation like lapis. armor, tools and block can be crafted (strongest in water on sunny days, stinky lines when having the full set(perferably pink)))
