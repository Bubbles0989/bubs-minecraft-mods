This is a spot for all of the minecraft mods I plan to make. I need to study Java and thought this would be the best way to do so. Finished JAR files will be put in a specific spot when I get done with any mods. 

## Roadmap

- :heavy_check_mark: Stone Armor Mod (My first one!)
- :thought_balloon: Many Armors Mod (An extension of my first one)
- :thought_balloon: Many Weapons Mod (And extension on the second one)
- :thought_balloon: More Animals Mod (Capybara)
